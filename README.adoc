= Capitalize Titles

Java API and command line program to capitalize English titles according to the APA style (in a best-effort manner).

_Caution:_ It doesn't perform any Grammar analysis and thus might incorrectly return some prepositions, conjunctions, adjective, or adverbs, such as yet, out, so, etc.

_Caution No 2:_ Has been created by a non-native speaker ðŸ™‚
